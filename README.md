ShameBot
========
Twitter bot that will tweet out names of teams that have dropped out of college ultimate frisbee tourneys with less than 7 days before the event

Built as an exercise in using node.js to tweet data scraped from a public google sheet

I host this on heroku, and throw all those important authorization tokens and whatnot in the ENV, y'know, for security and stuff

used these tutorials as starting points if you want to make your own
